The nz9-dns-server authoritative DNS server project has been successfully implemented and deployed. The server provides authoritative DNS responses for the bzo.in domain, correctly handling multiple record types while maintaining high performance and RFC compliance. Testing confirms that the DNS server operates according to specifications, with proper handling of all query types and error conditions.

Key achievements:

    Fully functional authoritative DNS server implementation in Rust
    Support for all major record types (A, NS, MX, SOA, TXT, PTR)
    Efficient caching mechanism with TTL-based eviction
    Dual transport support (UDP and TCP) on port 53
    Asynchronous I/O for high concurrency
    Robust error handling including NXDOMAIN responses
    SQLite backend for persistent zone data
    Standards compliance with RFC 1034/1035
